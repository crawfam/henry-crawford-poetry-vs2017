                            The wound rips open: You feel the welt<br />
                            of solitude, its hospital lights. Then you know<br />
                            you have arrived. It is to be one body<br />
                            and held in the palm of the doctor's hand.<br />
                            It is the gash of being seen.<br />
                            <br />
                            Now for the rest of your life<br />
                            you are trying to be born through a wound.<br />
                            That's loneliness. By a slip, or by some move<br />
                            more desperate, you have burned<br />
                            a purple shadow on your body.<br />
                            <br />
                            But death is not the subject of our portrait.<br />
                            It is the knowing you are seen,<br />
                            it is the lighting of one's light, it is to take<br />
                            a body, knowing you are not the body.<br />
                            That's loneliness.<br />
                            <br />
                            From Another City
