                        <p>                            
                            I'm in the back of the squad car like a perp,<br />
                            (the seats are too big. I feel like Alice),<br />
                            and I hear, in the police chatter, the word "carnie."<br />
                            It fits with the gamey smell of the blood running down my arm.<br />
                            The gauze from the paramedics has already unraveled.<br />
                            <br />
                            Carnie? They can't know, it's just their best guess<br />
                            but I go with it, thinking,<br />
                            it was different with the last one, in the last town<br />
                            and it will be different with the next woman in the next town.<br />
                            It will be a seedy act.<br />
                            <br />
                            To me, he's a cipher and a trickster.<br />
                            I met him, not amid the shrieks of children<br />
                            and the smell of old grease,<br />
                            but in a verdant place a quarter mile from the fairgrounds.<br />
                            <br />
                            This mysterious beast had the gift of speech.<br />
                            He said, "Lie down on the ground."<br />
                            He presented me with a challenge.<br />
                            He granted me a wish.<br />
                            <br />
                            I screamed the way I should have long ago.<br />
                            I screamed as he threw me onto the gravel.<br />
                            I screamed until he ran away.<br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            I didn't say, <br />
                            as I have so often in bedrooms and living rooms and conference rooms,<br />
                            "How can I help you meet your needs without wounding myself too badly?"<br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
