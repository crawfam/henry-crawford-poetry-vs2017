    Says Private Joe to Clara Barton "Why me<br />
    and not thee in this mud and blood losing<br />
    my life under these unusual trees pulling<br />
    the sun down and I'll be dead and never know<br />
    what happened to my boys and did they die<br />
    and where's my musket  and how will I shoot it<br />
    without my hands and my leg is burning<br />
    so much and God it's already lost and the sun<br />
    keeps falling into those trees please tell them<br />
    Miss Clara I'm good I swear oh God I'm good."<br />
    But Miss Clara was already gone and the war itself<br />
    soon ended and Lincoln was shot and everyone<br />
    moved on and then came a hundred years<br />
    of Jim Crow and Two World Wars and almost<br />
    a Third and somewhere in all this you were born<br />
    and picked up an education and maybe<br />
    you work in the city or live in some town<br />
    where the roads are wide and sometimes<br />
    showing us the way and sometimes not<br />
    but always leading us on to that larger place<br />
    where the things they did are never done.<br />
