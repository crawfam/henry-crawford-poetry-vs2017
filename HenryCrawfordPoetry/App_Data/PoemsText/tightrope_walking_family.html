                            something [about falling] you get an unobstructed view<br />
                            something [about faith] my feet on my father's shoulders<br />
                            something [about rules] when they say don't look down they mean it<br />
                            something [about performing] I'm only an employee<br />
                            something [about crowds] they're just eyes looking up<br />
                            something [about music] never listen to the drum roll<br />
                            something [about distance] the further you go the smaller you get<br />
                            something [about slipping] you'll know it before you know it<br />
                            something [about time] there's no going back even going backwards<br />
                            something [about balance] holding my sister's earnest hands<br />
                            something [about gravity] it's a two way street<br />
                            something [about disappointment] missing my mother's arms<br />
                            something [about magic] it never quite escapes the laws of nature<br />
                            something [about letting go] there's never enough net<br />
                            something [about mass] only the weightless never fall<br />
                            something [about going down] it doesn't last forever<br />
                            <br />
