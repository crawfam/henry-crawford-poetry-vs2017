<h1>The Last Gun</h1>
<p>
    The Last Gun is a poetic cycle in the voice of the last gun in existence. He is a hold-out, discovered when he goes off accidentally. A policeman arrests him and takes him to jail, where he awaits trial. In solitary confinement, gun has an opportunity to contemplate who he was in life and how he will meet his end. An excerpt from the cycle won the COG Poetry Award and was subsequently animated at Cogswell College.

    They thought I might be smart,<br />
    one of the ones they'd missed<br />
    when they originally boycotted<br />
    and kept the smart ones out of stores.
</p>
<p>
    Well, I'm not smart,<br />
    but I'm not stupid either—<br />
    really I'm not, in spite of that fracas<br />
    in the kid's garage.
</p>
<p>
    If I'd been smart, I mean like genius,<br />
    it never would've happened<br />
    and he'd be around today<br />
    to go hunting with his dad.
