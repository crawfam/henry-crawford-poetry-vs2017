            It was October in Montegufoni.<br />
            Steel-jawed crushers wolfed Chianti grapes <br />
            in joyous cartfuls, and pomegranates <br />
            insinuated purple light from dooryards.<br />
            I stood outside the castle, waiting <br />
            with the others for the <i>autobus</i> to take us<br />
            to Florence or Lucca or San Gimignano <br />
            when another bus, the color of <i>sorbetto di limone</i>, <br />
            pulled into view. Small children, taking <br />
            no notice of the queued-up Americans, <br />
            tumbled out of the bus, clutching soccer balls <br />
            and Hello Kitty or Donald Duck lunchboxes, <br />
            laughing in a language I did not know.<br />
            But I thought of another <i>bambina</i> just born <br />
            an ocean and a continent away, <br />
            her mother—my niece—the same northern mixture <br />
            of Irish-English-German-Dutch as me, <br />
            her father one generation removed <br />
            from Sicily and Abruzzo.
        </p>
        <p>
            And now I think of <i>due bambini</i>, <br />
            sister and brother, growing up in a place <br />
            where crushers wolf Cabernet and Zinfandel grapes <br />
            for Mondavi, Parducci, Sebastiani.<br />
            The first time they went to Italy, they wanted <br />
            to travel by balloon. The second time, <br />
            Pope Francis blessed them at Easter Mass.<br />
            They're renowned from Pescara to Santa Rosa, <br />
            these mighty swimmers and marathon readers, <br />
            heroes of Golden State soccer fields, <br />
            fans of Team Italia, growers of pomegranates.
