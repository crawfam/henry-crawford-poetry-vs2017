                        All crowded&nbsp;&nbsp;today<br />
                        like an overgrown meadow<br />
                        alive with color, <br />
                        <br />
                        with swaying, with sand .<br />
                        It makes a case for the heart<br />
                        to open its fist and receive<br />
                        <br />
                        like they&nbsp;&nbsp;do, the dolphins, <br />
                        now lifting, wheels turning <br />
                        their rhythm of breath.<br />
                        <br />
                        They send and receive <br />
                        in equal measure.<br />
                        Sound is their light <br />
                        <br />
                        that beams through the water, <br />
                        meets matter that’s dense, <br />
                        copies it home to the brain—<br />
                        <br />
                        revising,&nbsp;&nbsp;moment <br />
                        by moment, their place <br />
                        in this soft constellation.<br />
                        <br />
