        <p> 
            Love's expensive. Who can afford it? <br />
            So you borrow from the bad guys, lay<br />
            your body down for collateral,<br />
            but the vig's ridiculous. No choice<br />
            but to pay and pay. Every day it's<br />
            just a matter of interest. You'll <br />
            never even scratch the principal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
            But love's a gamble, right? Sometimes it<br />
            comes up red. Other times, it comes up<br />
            black. Go ahead. Put down all you're worth. <br />
            Hope for the really <i>really</i> big score.<br />
            <br />
            From <i>The Vig of Love</i>.
