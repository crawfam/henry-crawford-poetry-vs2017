                <p>    
                I never saw the airport van coming<br />
                it just showed up<br />
                wrapped in pre-dawn blue<br />
                carting us off in car seat rows of three<br />
                sitting straight-faced<br />
                immune to our arms and legs<br />
                simmering in our suits.<br />
                <br />
                Airports are made for leaving<br />
                white corridors of boxed<br />
                electric frescos of smiling models<br />
                beaming with light-emitting<br />
                teeth and I’m losing time<br />
                with every step<br />
                dragged along on rolling<br />
                luggage feet.<br />
                <br />
                Black ribbon intake aisles greet me<br />
                with open poles<br />
                moving now in ad hoc inches<br />
                empty shoes in hand<br />
                I stand before the final x-ray<br />
                sock-footed<br />
                with an actor’s face making my case <br />
                for getting through.<br />
                <br />
                I whisper goodbye to my phone<br />
                (“I’ll call you tonight.”)<br />
                and I am alone<br />
                as a runaway child<br />
                tromping down the boarding box<br />
                holding my handles<br />
                finding my row<br />
                taking my seat<br />
                all strapped in<br />
                flying away.<br />
                <br />
