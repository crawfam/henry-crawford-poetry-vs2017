    Sun is butter on my mother's face,<br />
    spills like apple juice over Becky's<br />
    highchair, down her front. Her black curls, <br />
    sticky with breakfast, stick out
</p>
<p>
    every which way, gilded with Cheerios.<br />
    My mother also sports a Cheerio, a jaunty<br />
    stowaway, half hidden under a curl. <br />
    My daughter and my mother poke out
</p>
<p>
    their tongues, wave them like crazy flags.<br />
    Brian clicks off the slide projector, <br />
    pats the machine like a geriatric friend.<br />
    Becky has just turned twenty two,
</p>
<p>
    skypes her British boyfriend every night <br />
    planning her trip to London.<br />
    Three weeks later I get an email <br />
    from East Anglia. <i>Mom, don't have</i>
</p>
<p>
    <i>a heart attack but I used your Visa card</i><br />
    <i>for a pregnancy test. Don't worry.</i><br />
    <i>It's not for me. I bought it for a friend.</i> <br />
    I believe her, of course.
</p>
<p>
    I write, <i>Thanks for the warning</i>.<br />
    <i>You're always so good to your friends.</i><br />
    I sit back, measure sugar into my tea. <br />
    I let my heart rate slow.
</p>
<p>
    I'll never tell her how it pounded,<br />
    six beats&mdash;worry, <br />
    three beats&mdash;fear,<br />
    one beat&mdash;joy.
