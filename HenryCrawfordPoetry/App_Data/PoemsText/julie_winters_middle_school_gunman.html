                        <p>                            
                            Maybe by now, <br />
                            the brains of the headline writers<br />
                            are locked: <br />
                            94 incidents, or 23 shootings per day,<br />
                            or 1 shooting every 8 school days this year— <br />
                            however it is counted, a kid with a gun at school<br />
                            is news that doesn't seem like news,<br />
                            even though <br />
                            "you wouldn't think in a small town like here it could happen,"<br />
                            and you understand the terror of the parents of all the students,<br />
                            can feel their righteous relief now that it is over,<br />
                            the gunman having killed himself after exchanging fire with police,<br />
                            and doesn't that sound grown up and calculated?<br />
                            You can picture him taking a shot and slipping behind a wall, <br />
                            see the quick shallow breaths as he rests from his exertions,<br />
                            hiding from the bullets that must be raining down on him,<br />
                            until he realizes there is no getting out of this,<br />
                            maybe he never intended to, maybe it was all leading up<br />
                            to this moment of decision where he takes himself out,<br />
                            and the article doesn't mention his parents,<br />
                            whose son may have been cold and hard by age 13,<br />
                            or innocent a year ago, or simply lost, or desperate.<br />
                            We are unlikely to ever hear from them, <br />
                            and when you can forget that there are parents,<br />
                            you can forget that a 14-year-old boy<br />
                            became a man<br />
                            in the space of a headline.<br />
