                        <p>    
                        we meet for coffee<br />
                        diner windows flush with dawn<br />
                        she comes in from the street <br />
                        we share a plate of bacon strips<br />
                        my once vegetarian child<br />
                        never this old<br />
                            <br /><br />
                        I'm driving her to the methadone clinic<br />
                        these rain damp streets a maze<br />
                        of traffic cones and sideways signs<br />
                        we go right at the railroad crossing<br />
                        I don't ask where she's living<br />
                        anymore<br />
                            <br /><br />
                        nowadays its NPR in the car<br />
                        neither of us listening<br />
                        I'd like to know her favorite song<br />
                        as if she could hand me a burned CD<br />
                        as if we could just waltz it all back<br />
                        she has no phone<br />
                            <br /><br />
                        almost 90 mornings clean<br />
                        her shiny black hair unwinding<br />
                        all tight skin and darting eyes<br />
                        her thin knees clutching the seat<br />
                        somewhere between urgency<br />
                        and nonchalance <br />
                            <br /><br />
                        I've come to know this place<br />
                        people milling around the clinic<br />
                        there's a Chinese take-out<br />
                        a burned-out doughnut shop<br />
                        a storefront church<br />
                        and then a space comes free<br />
                        and I let her out<br />
                            <br />
