                            &nbsp;1: &nbsp;&nbsp;Galaxies everywhere. Dense and bright as pixels on a blank white screen.<br />
                            &nbsp;2: &nbsp;&nbsp;On Earth it was an ordinary day of baseball, worship and television violence.<br />
                            &nbsp;3: &nbsp;&nbsp;The Maluvians appeared to Rita in a fractal designed as a dream.<br />
                            &nbsp;5: &nbsp;&nbsp;"Your weakness," spoke Goron, "is the space you allow for silence."<br />
                            &nbsp;8: &nbsp;The Sonnosphere was an equation, a poem, and a book of the hidden.<br />
                            13: &nbsp;&nbsp;Mindstorms along the borders made the plot impossible to detect.<br />
                            21: &nbsp;&nbsp;Rita saw lines growing on a thin sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br />
                            34: &nbsp;"What? You thought this would be like an episode of your Star Trek?"<br />
                            55: &nbsp;"Earthlings," cried the one centimeter alien, "your words are inconsequential."<br />
                            89: &nbsp;The victims were forced to sing forever, having glimpsed the Sonnosphere.<br />
                            144: &nbsp;"They never knew of life," thought Goron, "not even a little."<br />
                            233: &nbsp;Rita's final aria brought even the blind eye Sun to molten yellow tears.<br />
                            377: &nbsp;As a machine planet the Earth found the solace it'd always sought.<br />
                            610: &nbsp;Beyond the solar winds the Maluvians looked back on a small blue dot.<br />
