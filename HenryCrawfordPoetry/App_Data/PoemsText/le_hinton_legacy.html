            <i>&hellip;and one day, for each of us, the sun will go down for the last, last time.</i>

            We've always been foolish about legacy,<br />
            but even the trees don't decide how <br />
            they'll be remembered. Will it be for the pleasure <br />
            of an afternoon of shade or as an obstacle <br />
            in the path of progress? They have no choice.<br />
            And you and I are less than the trees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Imagine a scene in New Jersey.<br />
            The woods, the underbrush. An Aaron Burr,<br />
            his gun still smoking. A Hamilton <br />
            lying on the ground waiting to die <br />
            the next day. Burr's legacy shot to hell.
        </p>

            Just a few years before, together they saved Levi <br />
            Weeks. Kept him from hanging for killing <br />
            his girlfriend. But in this moment, with the trees <br />
            watching and the brush becoming redder,<br />
            no one cares about that history,<br />
            except Levi.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weeks moved on to Mississippi. Built <br />
            houses for the rich. Mansions with names <br />
            and plantations attached. Like Auburn <br />
            with its tall columns and portico. A spiral <br />
            staircase and fancy woodwork. Stephen Duncan<br />
            stands on (t)his porch and avoids thinking about<br />
            the shacks out back. Doesn't care to <br />
            see his young property, James and <br />
            Joseph, laughing, playing, running races<br />
            before they go off to the fields.

            He considers his empire. Counts <br />
            his acres and slaves, his money<br />
            and magnolias. The buying and selling<br />
            of children and cotton. Calculates the cost <br />
            of goodness, the price of being remembered.
        </p>
        <p>
            Burr's bullet shattered a rib. Hamilton's <br />
            shot found a blameless red oak. <br />
            The bullets, the rib, the oak had no say.
        </p>
        <p>
            And you and I are less than the trees <br />
            who are sawed and sanded, <br />
            stained and polished,<br />
            heirloomed and remembered.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, you may be mulch. <br />
            In the end, I may be splintered,<br />
            or we all may be consumed <br />
            in a fire of forgetting.<br />
