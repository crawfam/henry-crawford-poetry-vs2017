	One small boat pitched<br />
	on the dark sea — One child<br />
	cast up on the cold shore.
</p>
<p>
	Here is the fulcrum of our age:<br />
	The bandit wind<br />
	has stolen the music of breath.
</p>
<p>
	Now all roads west are<br />
	chuckablock with broken prams,<br />
	carts laden with bundled dreams.
</p>
<p>
	So useless to write of this<br />
	safe by the warming fire,<br />
	an ocean distant.
</p>
<p>
	Beside the railroad gate<br />
	ten thousand pairs of hands<br />
	reach out for water.
</p>
<p>
	Behind them, fire, ahead<br />
	the ache of night — I cannot<br />
	suss the choice I'd make.
</p>
<p>
	I have no words for this.<br />
	It moves from words<br />
	toward a deeper pulse.
</p>
<p>
	And we are lost between <br />
	ocean and sky, with nothing<br />
	to hold but each other.
</p>
