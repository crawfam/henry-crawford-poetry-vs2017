                        <p>    
                        I came in after midnight<br />
                        I drove all night to get here<br />
                        I am shaky<br />
                        I lit up a cigarette<br />
                        I got a Coke from the machine<br />
                        I am reeling with dope<br />
                        I am feeling the glow behind the dials<br />
                        I let myself in<br />
                        <br />
                        [With the lights out, it's less dangerous]<br />
                        <br />
                        I have no microphone<br />
                        I sing to myself<br />
                        I sing in sheets of sharpened glass<br />
                        I hear the words between my temples<br />
                        I look out the control booth<br />
                        I see a city burning in the controls<br />
                        <br />
                        [Here we are now, entertain us]<br />
                        <br />
                        I asked my agent<br />
                        I asked how many more days<br />
                        I am looking out the moving bus<br />
                        I stammer in the mirror<br />
                        I am waking up in strange places<br />
                        I shared too much<br />
                        I shared too little<br />
                        I think "my needs are getting out of hand"<br />
                        <br />
                        [I feel stupid and contagious]<br />
                        <br />
                        I've had some bad nights<br />
                        I've looked out across an empty arena<br />
                        I've lost my place in the song<br />
                        I woke up in the Mississippi plains<br />
                        I walked into a house lit up<br />
                        I saw Blind Lemon strumming in the kitchen<br />
                        I saw Muddy staring at me in the hallway<br />
                        <br />
                        [Here we are now, entertain us]<br />
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I am an outsider to myself<br />
                        I have no senses to come to<br />
                        I am the inside living without<br />
                        I'm a voice too hard to hear<br />
                        I want to be straight [a mulatto]<br />
                        I want to be drunk [an albino]<br />
                        I want to show you [a mosquito]<br />
                        I want to hide you [my libido]<br />
                        I am empty [yeah]<br />
                        I am full [yeah]<br />
                        I'm [denial]<br />
                        [Yeah]<br />
                        </p>
