                    If I unteach my kiss or unwake my morning<br />
                    And star the days that rise beyond<br />
                    If I reach back to where the newness lives<br />
                    And firsts flowed by <br />
                    If I undo my done-ings<br />
                    And near the point of dreaming<br />
                    Get there and then come back to now<br />
                    With any gathered loops or straw long gone<br />
                    If I but ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I return to us<br />
                    And unteach my kiss or untime my shirt<br />
                    Or unhum arrows<br />   
                    If I begin again all over	<br />
                    If I act like onions do in Autumn<br />
                    And love surprise as if it plunked the surface<br />
                    If I unteach my lips to dwell<br />
                    And if all that or more becomes my taken for granted<br />
                    If I unteach my kiss<br />
                    If I unlearn my every now of you <br />
                    To swim.
