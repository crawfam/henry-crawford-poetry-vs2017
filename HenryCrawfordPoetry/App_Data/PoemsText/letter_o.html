                            behind oaks. O: the fifteenth letter, shown by Phoenicians <br />
                            with a dot in the middle, as if eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;O: the mind waking. O <br />
                            slashed: the mind oscillating, just before sleep. O: on Oahu,<br />

                            begins. O: a love cry, a grief cry, a word meaning these two are <br />
                            one. O with umlaut: your saxophone, hitting high E. O: the shape <br />
                            of your matted head pushing out of me. O: my os mirroring. O: <br />
                            your lips just before you took your first breath. O: what I called <br />
                            out when I rocked you and our eyes were Phoenician—O's looking <br />
                            into O's:&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>O daughter</i>, <i>O snow goose</i>, <i>oh-no-gnome</i>, <i>my only O</i>.<br />
