                        <p>
                            My hands glow blue<br />
                            in light struck from red<br />
                            <br />
                            rock. Sky-parched,<br />
                            I stumble, bleached<br />
                            <br />
                            by dark, bent from reading,<br />
                            deaf with rain.<br />
                            <br />
                            A raven's croak<br />
                            echoes off canyon walls.<br />
                            <br />
                            In snow-melt air,<br />
                            the smell of pine rings.<br />
                            <br />
                            Blue-gray junipers jump<br />
                            from crevices, hanging on.<br />
                            <br />
                            <i>Nopales</i>, hungry, spread<br />
                            their blue-green palms.<br />
                            <br />
                            Light is writing<br />
                            white-gold letters on cloud.<br />
                            <br />
                            See me, <br />
                            blue-white sun, <br />
                            <br />
                            fill me, too, <br />
                            chlorophyll me.<br />
                            <br />
                            <br />
