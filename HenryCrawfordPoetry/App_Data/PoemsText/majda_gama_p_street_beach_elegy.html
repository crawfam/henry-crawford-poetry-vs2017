                        <p>  
                        Before the fists flew, <br />
                        the gang was all languor; <br />
                        a mass tangle of black <br />
                        leather limbs and boots.	<br />
                        40's stood sentry on the slip. <br />
                        Some lay discarded like<br />
                        slumped menhirs on pagan earth.<br />
                        We littered the ground with fags, <br />
                        you filled the air with slurred <br />
                        words. Agent, the gutterpunk <br />
                        reserved the best slur for you:<br />
                        <i>sandnigger</i> and up you shot, <br />
                        nails raking his face <br />
                        before I could snake between <br />
                        and turn his blow. We three <br />
                        grappled like teen lovers, <br />
                        all curses and fumbles;<br />
                        fell heaving to the ground, <br />
                        reached for more beer. <br />
                        <i>Rum, Sodomy, and the Lash</i><br />
                        read the badge closest to your heart. <br />
                        We drank three cheers to that. <br />                                                   
                        </p>
