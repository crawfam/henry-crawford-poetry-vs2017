                            as] you combed your watery hair<br />
                            as] the photographer chatted up your mom<br />
                            as] sister snapped her bathing cap<br />
                            as] the family marched to the diving board<br />
                            as] the photographer set up the pose<br />
                            as] the Ocean Motel offered a terrace layered backdrop<br />
                            as] the sun wore off its color<br />

                            as] mom clasped your open shoulder<br />
                            as] you turned one eye away<br />
                            as] the photographer shouted, "now!"<br />
                            <br />
                            as] the camera filled with visible light<br />
                            as] a solo wave broke anonymously away<br />
                            as] you slid into the pool<br />
                            as] the diving board sprung back<br />
                            as] you broke the plane of water<br />
                            as] chlorine re-closed your eyes<br />
                            as] they all walked back into forgotten time<br />
                            as] each pixel lights up in a window looking out<br />
                            as] you screen the reverse miracle of years<br />
                            as] their night was coming ashore<br />
