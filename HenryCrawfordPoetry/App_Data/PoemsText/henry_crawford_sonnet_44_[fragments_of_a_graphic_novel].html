        Page&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22:&nbsp;&nbsp;Pregnant with child, looped on acid, she stepped cautiously into the Lucky Bar.<br />
        Page&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56:&nbsp;&nbsp;"You call this love Manny? To me it feels like a dope deal gone bad."<br />
        Page&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60:&nbsp;&nbsp;Dottie was equally blunt, "don't do it, Jeannie," as she pulled away in her car.<br />
        Page&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;74:&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't like people from the past. To Joe it was just digging up the dead.<br />
        Page&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;97:&nbsp;&nbsp;Would she meet him at the station? He didn't know. And he didn't care.<br />
        Page 103:&nbsp;&nbsp;Manny kept a roll of hundreds in a box under the bar next to a loaded Glock 44.<br />
        Page 139:&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yeah, Joe just blew in from Hialeah. He says he really made a score down there."<br />
        Page 151:&nbsp;&nbsp;The sofa was falling apart, but what the hell, "Just a place to sleep, nothing more."<br />
        Page 160:&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look Jeannie, this time we're going to do it my way, so don't even ask."<br />
        Page 172:&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain fell into the headlights of cars like the illuminated bullets of a city in tears.<br />
        Page 198:&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut. Now hand me the cash!"<br />
        Page 210:&nbsp;&nbsp;There's nothing ironic about an empty 44. Joe was dead. The money was theirs.<br />
        Page 229:&nbsp;&nbsp;Manny took one last look at Jeannie before she disappeared into the night.<br />
        Page 230:&nbsp;&nbsp;She was all Queens Boulevard without the streets, the cars or the light.<br />
