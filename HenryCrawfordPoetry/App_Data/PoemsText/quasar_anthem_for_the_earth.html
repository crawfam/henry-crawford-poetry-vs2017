    "sic'm!&nbsp;&nbsp;sic'm! we got'm on the run!<br />
    sic'm!&nbsp;&nbsp;sic'm!"--you can almost hear<br />
    the hunters cry on their dogs— the<br />
    hunters that are we ourselves! We<br />
    have met the prey face-to-face:<br />
    it is we who are hounding<br />
    it is we who are driving<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prey, hurtling, off the cliff down, down, onto the bedrock bottom<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the open pit of extinction splat!&nbsp;&nbsp;the prey begins to crumple...<br />
    we see it in slow motion<br />
    we have met the prey face-to-face: it<br />
    is we who are hounding ourselves-it<br />
    is we who are driving ourselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
    hurtling off the cliff&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--we see<br />
    it in slow motion-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our<br />
    hurtling off the cliff<br />
    down, down, onto the bedrock bottom<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the open pit of extinction we<br />
    are digging our own pit into our nest, the<br />
    Earth:&nbsp;&nbsp;all Earth, Earth is our nest.<br />
    we are bleeding the Earth and the Earth, <br />
    all Earth, Earth is our nest.<br />
    the Earth is bleeding black blood<br />
    the Earth is bleeding brown-gray smoke-smudge.<br />
    we cannot staunch the flow from the<br />
    Earth, our Earth...our blood... and the<br />
    Earth, all Earth, Earth is our nest.<br />
    Homo sapiens is sucking the blood<br />
    of its own nest-bed Homo<br />
    sapiens is def'cating and ur'nating,<br />
    dumping crushed bones and rancid flesh<br />
    into the open pit of its own nest and the Earth,<br />
    all Earth, Earth is our nest.
</p>
<p>
    only dying species excrete in their nests it<br />
    is a sign of a dying species&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to<br />
    dump its refuse, its own dung,<br />
    into its nest, its own nest-we see it all in<br />
    slow motion:<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fall, the crumple, the writhing<br />
    moanwrestling in the nest as the nest falls apart<br />
    and the Earth, all Earth, Earth is our nest.<br />
    the Earth is our arteries, our blood<br />
    veins, our lymph flow, our gut the Earth is our<br />
    nerve web, we feel pulsations in the air, rock and<br />
    sea we receive the buzz of bees in the flowers,<br />
    corn-grasses, and trees we love the whales' honey<br />
    in our ears we love the waves of fragrance<br />
    wafting and curling with soft edges in our nest,<br />
    the Earth:&nbsp;&nbsp;all Earth, Earth is our nest.
</p>
<p>
    as we learn to fly and leave our nest we must<br />
    bend down, scrape, and clean our nest instead, we<br />
    play with money in the muck instead, we suck off <br />
    the nest of its blood and the Earth, all Earth, Earth<br />
    is our nest.
</p>
<p>
    Homo sapiens, species we, now catch ourselves!-<br />
    as we fall into the open pit...<br />
    Homo sapiens!--let's catch our own dung<br />
    before it falls to Earth, our nest,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our own<br />
    nest, Earth, all Earth. Homo sapiens on the road to<br />
    extinction!-let's turn the sign from "go" to "stop!<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--and slow!"<br />
    so we can rest and grow, grow and rest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in<br />
    our nest, our own living nest,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth-<br />
    all Earth, Earth is our nest and Earth, all Earth,<br />
    Earth is our nest.<br />
