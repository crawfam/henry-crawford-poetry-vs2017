    <p>
        It's bad enough that the grizzlies<br />
        roared at us, hardly twenty yards<br />
        from our car. I had to roll down
    </p>
    <p>
        the windows, smear lard on my skin,<br />
        and whistle, "Come and get it!"<br />
        The family that survived reminded me
    </p>
    <p>
        how I strung a tightrope over<br />
        the lion exhibit at the zoo, dressed<br />
        as an antelope, smelling like red meat.
    </p>
    <p>
        How I insulted each and every Mamma<br />
        of the Marines at the bar, without<br />
        knowing the slightest self-defense.
    </p>
    <p>
        It would be best if I were restrained<br />
        by ropes, chains. That a gag be sealed<br />
        over my unfortunate mouth. Always
    </p>
    <p>
        I escaped whatever prison held me,<br />
        throwing off restraints, wiggling through bonds.<br />
        It was my duty to worsen the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
        My brain always had another good idea.<br />
        It soon woke to see me in a full body cast.<br />
        My limbs suspended. A straw though my lips.
