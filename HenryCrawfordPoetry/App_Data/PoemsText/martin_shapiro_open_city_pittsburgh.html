                                Streetlights dim Janet and me:&nbsp;&nbsp;we're shaken<br />
                                after a late screening of <i>Open City</i><br />
                                at the Carnegie proves too real:&nbsp;&nbsp;the actor<br />
                                who played the priest, a hero murdered<br />
                                by fascists, looked a lot like Father Almo,<br />
                                our gutsy, heavy-set professor.<br />
                                Rome was under curfew; Craig Street seems so—<br />
                                empty sidewalks, closed shops.&nbsp;&nbsp;An unmarked car<br />
                                <br />
                                swerves toward us, revving. It lurches to a stop.<br />
                                A window lowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The high school guys inside<br />
                                smirk—at Janet's dreadlocks?&nbsp;&nbsp;My beret?<br />
                                <i>Don't act afraid</i>, she whispers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Too late:&nbsp;&nbsp;they saw<br />
                                me cower, quickly straighten, then attempt<br />
                                firmer steps and clenched fists.&nbsp;&nbsp;They still read fear.<br />
                                A kid leers out, wrings his face into a slur,<br />
                                hurls a bottle—it clinks across the curb.<br />
                                <br />
                                The car squats hard on its wheels and roars<br />
                                past the blacked-out cathedral:&nbsp;&nbsp;they'll be back,<br />
                                so we fast-forward, shrink into tree shadows,<br />
                                slip behind bus kiosks, to Janet's house<br />
                                on the Heights, where her dad, waiting, growls <br />
                                <i>good night</i>, slams the door on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I could try<br />
                                a long run downhill to my room, while<br />
                                the unmufflered ones, future fascist louts,<br />
                                <br />
                                rampage other streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they return,<br />
                                there's a little time to tuck into safe space,<br />
                                a courtyard, behind a hedge or parked car. . .<br />
                                And yet, I must remember to breathe.<br />
                                A wind shift sweeps the city airshed clean<br />
                                of metal and begins to dry my sweat.<br />
                                Fireflies drift, slow to gleam, slow to release.<br />
                                I find a crisp quarter moon.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sidewalk glitters.<br />
                            <br />
