                        Tight turn right turn left – navigate by <br />
                        Mars or Venus embedded in August’<br />
                        dome of night – don’t need a moral <br />
                        compass to find the tavern where<br />
                        I linger, elbow for a spot<br />
                        beside an obtuse man canting over<br />
                        the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;His elbow jabs back as I rock<br />
                        toward the fog –&nbsp;&nbsp;shaved ice and a jigger, <br />
                        Canadian Club, vermouth, and bitters. <br />
                        He tells a lawyer lightbulb joke – how many<br />
                        can you afford –&nbsp;&nbsp;and rants he’ll make<br />
                        a 180-switch – parties or positions –<br />
                        to land on the winning team.&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider<br />
                        my next move – to play an angle and avoid<br />
                        plain sight or commit to a candidate. <br />
                        The floor’s wood is slick, the wall’s American<br />
                        flag framed and lit, whiskey bottles sweat,<br />
                        reflect encrypted features – not much rhyme<br />
                        but there’s still belief to be internalized.<br />
                        My mindful rabbi whispers – drop<br />
                        the filibuster in the chamber’s pot,<br />
                        resign from the race.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chants of Namaste<br />
                        resonate under the dome on the Hill. <br />
