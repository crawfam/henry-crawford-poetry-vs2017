                            These are old occupations. In Vatican City there is no<br />
                            internet, not until after they've sent their white smoke<br />
                            rising. Black smoke means they're still at it. Here <br />
                            it would mean the bagel's burning. There's no white kind.<br />
                            They used to carry them around on sticks, which is why<br />
                            the hole in the middle, and we keep it even though<br />
                            sometimes the butter ends up pooling right in the middle <br />
                            of the plate. We keep things the way they are. <br />
                            The Cardinals—do they sit around a table, a dark table <br />
                            older than America? They may have bagels of their own, <br />
                            though it's hard to imagine them licking cream cheese<br />
                            off their thumbs. But things do change. They used to <br />
                            lock the bishops in the chapel until they got it done, and now <br />
                            there are hotels and buses. They wake up to a coffee maker,<br />
                            maybe a continental breakfast. And I've got a toaster, <br />
                            and a food processor to make the hummus, everything<br />
                            I need. There may be windows high up in the wall,<br />
                            shuttered. Nobody's allowed to see things in process. <br />
                            The Cardinals crowd around, one of them almost a Pope. Me,<br />
                            I'm already eating the bagel. <br />
                            <br />
