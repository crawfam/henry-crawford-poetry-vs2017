I don’t think a man ever gets to know who he really is<br />
I think, we are all disinclined in that way, and though<br />
I would like to say, that<br />
I saw everything and that it was all laid out before me, that<br />
I was presented with the facts, that my decisions were well informed, that<br />
I knew what I needed to know, and<br />
I think that for the most part<br />
I did, but now at the end of the day,<br />
I can’t say for sure that <br />
I ever really knew. You know<br />
<br />
I did not start that war<br />
I did not go in there thinking, “Let’s get these god damned gooks”<br />
I did not wake up one morning dreaming of choppers spitting fire from the sky<br />
I did not go out there and pull these young men off the streets<br />
I did not lure them to this war like some Sunday morning glory dreamer<br />
I did not, but<br />
I also know in another way that<br />
I did. Or maybe it was just that<br />
<br />
I was born into a state too long and too wide to be fully comprehended, and<br />
I was never able to shake off the cold coming down from the hills<br />
I had big dreams in those Texas mornings<br />
I mean a man can see himself one way and also see himself completely different<br />
I can love you or make you think I love you and it really doesn’t matter which is true<br />
I saw my mom and dad and they wore their love like a holy stone<br />
I saw their ordinary mornings; her hat, his hand <br />
I saw the dust all around them<br />
I saw the dust, but as I think back on it now<br />
I never saw it at all<br />
I couldn’t see.<br />
<br />
I think you could come down here and think anything was possible<br />
I knew a man came down here with half-a-dollar in his pocket and made a fortune<br />
I believed <br />
I could do anything, make things happen, get out in front<br />
I thought I had a clear sense of what was true, that<br />
I had come up from solid ground, but somehow<br />
I got tripped up, and it was all quicksand, and<br />
I believed I was doing the right thing, but now<br />
I don’t think<br />
I ever knew. And that is why<br />
<br />
I say a man never gets to know who he really is, more than that<br />
I dare not say<br />
I am not going to try to redeem myself, and<br />
I am not going to harbor regret as would a weaker man, and<br />
I am not saying that everything I did was right, but sometimes<br />
I wonder if there’s a way to know the score, and<br />
I would like to know the score, but <br />
I also know that to some extent<br />
I never will. <br />
