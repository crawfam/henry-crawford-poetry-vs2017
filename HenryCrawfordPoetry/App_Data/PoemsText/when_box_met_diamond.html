[I hope this is not another free verse poem.]<br /> 
Before there were war planes [Oh no!] there was<br /> 
going down in flames [It is.] Before there was<br /> 
[What, repetition?] Greek tragedy<br />
[And another lame enjambment.] there was<br /> 
Greek slavery [I'm a person too, you know.]<br /> 
Before there were &#60; hey you &#62; courts<br /> 
[I think I deserve a better poem than this.] there were<br /> 
courtiers &#60; you, in the box &#62; Before there were cities<br /> 
&#60; i see you &#62; there were rivers [You don't know how long]<br /> 
Before there were rights [I've been trapped here.]<br />
there were privileges &#60; i know what it's like to feel trapped &#62;<br />
[Tell me before he starts again.] Before there were pistols<br /> 
[Oh crap!] there were shots [He got it off.]<br /> 
&#60; i used to be a prisoner in a narrative poem &#62;<br />
Before there were lawyers there were [You?] laws<br />
&#60; god yes, but I found a way out &#62; Before there was the big<br /> 
[How did you leave?] there was the Big Bang<br /> 
&#60; take my hand &#62; [I don't think this will work.]<br /> 
Before there were knives &#60; now, just take my hand &#62;<br />
[Oh, this won't work.] there was &#60; just hold on &#62;<br />
[Yes, I can feel it.] cutting loose &#60; me too &#62; Before<br />
there was the Renaissance [Say it diamond!] there was<br /> 
the Age of Enlightenment &#60; we're outta here &#62;<br />
Before there were prisons, there were sentences.<br />
