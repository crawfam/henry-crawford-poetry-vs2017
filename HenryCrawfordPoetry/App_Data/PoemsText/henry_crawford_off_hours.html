                        After the late shift<br />
                        the cops will drop by.<br />
                        Shots and a beer.<br />
                        Nightsticks on the bar.<br />
                        <br />
                        In a back booth<br />
                        I dream my mother laughing<br />
                        and there she is – laughing.<br />
                        Her smudged mouth wide,<br />
                        always longing.<br />
                        <br />
                        “We gotta go now<br />
                        little guy,” her breath<br />
                        wet and pine tree<br />
                        sweet, her boiled eyes <br />
                        looking hard to see.<br />
                        <br />
                        The jukebox is dark.<br />
                        A tired jumble of moths <br />
                        circle the bald bar light.<br />
                        Even the cops are gone. <br />
                        <br />
                        These streets belong to us now.<br />
                        The radio knows this hour well.<br />
                        My mother is singing to the wheel.<br />
                        I’m in the backseat<br />
                        pretending sleep, tracing<br />
                        the roads in my mind<br />
                        just minutes before morning<br />
                        on that slow roll home.<br />
                        <br />
                            <br />
