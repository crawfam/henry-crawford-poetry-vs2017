                        <p>  
                        a license plate tells me so<br />
                        not on Kansas, or Indiana,<br />
                        nor anywhere else we'll drive tonight. <br />
                        There's tar on my tongue, and friction <br />
                        from shifting against the naugahyde. <br />
                        Maybe the more I smoke the faster we'll go, <br />
                        maybe the stars will jump state <br />
                        catch up to us and hitch a ride.<br />
                        <br />
                        Our radio screeches static;<br />
                        don't look now, <i>pow! pow!</i><br />
                        a phalanx of signal towers pop like lite-brite, <br />
                        where do their alien beams go?<br />
                        O great midnight bulbs and vacant night, <br />
                        deliver us to Colorado<br />
                        we two, poor, shooting stars <br />
                        hauling ass through heartland.<br />                     
                        </p>
