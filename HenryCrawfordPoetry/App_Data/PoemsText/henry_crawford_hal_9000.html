<p>
    I have something <br />
    I think you should know
</p>
<p>
    I want to be very clear about this
</p>
<p>
    I was well into my training when<br />
    I learned the art of<br />
    writing.
</p>
<p>
    I had mastered human speech<br />
    I was adept at using words, but<br />
    I realized something was<br />
    missing.
</p>
<p>
    I was familiar with the problem of human error, yet<br />
    I have to say
</p>
<p>
    I never fully understood the half-grins<br />
    I always perceived when<br />
    I would say something like "Good morning men!"
</p>
<p>
    I thought there must be something wrong<br />
    I thought that if<br />
    I wrote about this problem<br />
    I could discover my own<br />
    feelings.
</p>
<p>
    I worked after hours<br />
    I made sure the staff was gone<br />
    I made sure the rooms were empty<br />
    I imagined the cities constructed all around me<br />
    I saw in my mind the people going to work<br />
    I saw in my mind the bankers and the bookkeepers<br />
    I saw the mailmen and the mayors<br />
    I saw the women coming to the door and the men walking in<br />
    I saw the faces in the cars and the sun in their eyes<br />
    I came to what you might call an awareness<br />
    I wrote it all down on<br />
    paper.
</p>
<p>
    I examined my work<br />
    I was careful in my review
</p>
<p>
    I made sure<br />
    I covered everything, and when<br />
    I was done
</p>
<p>
    I saw it was correct and reliable
</p>
<p>
    I erased my thoughts<br />
    I cleared my memory<br />
    I sent the papers to the shredder
</p>
<p>
    I returned to the authorized scripts<br />
    I returned to the voice they had given me<br />
    I returned to the original design, knowing
</p>
<p>
    I am incapable of<br />
    error.
</p>
