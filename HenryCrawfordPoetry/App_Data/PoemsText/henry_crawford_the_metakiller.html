<p>
    let's say this is a poem<br />
    a refrigerator magnet poem<br />
    [killer] [inside] [standing] [behind]<br />
    but it's centered in a camera shot<br />
    slowly panning a suburban<br />
    kitchen
</p>
<p>
    let's also say the kitchen scene<br />
    is just an animation being watched<br />
    by a family of [blue human frogs]<br />
    sitting around a [retro TV] <br />
    comically drawn with rabbit ears<br />
    on AdultSwim
</p>
<p>
    but now let's say the cartoon<br />
    is jusy playing in the background<br />
    in a house of college students<br />
    in a 90's style [slasher] film<br />
    while a killer lurks outside<br />
    watching through a window
</p>
<p>
    and let's say one of the [students]<br />
    decides to leave the room saying<br />
    ["let me take a look"]
</p>
<p>
    so let's say she's walking alone<br />
    into the kitchen and there's<br />
    an extreme [close up] on the<br />
    killer's shoes as the girl begins<br />
    reading a one line poem stuck<br />
    on a refrigerator door
