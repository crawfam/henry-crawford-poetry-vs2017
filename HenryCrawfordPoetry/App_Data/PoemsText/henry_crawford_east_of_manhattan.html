                        <p>    
                        Janey and I sat<br />
                        on the rocks near a dock<br />
                        of blackened wood.<br />
                        <br />
                        Across the water<br />
                        Rikers Island drained <br />
                        the last of the 4:30 light.<br />
                        <br />
                        My mouth was wet with <br />
                        a winter kiss. I licked<br />
                        my lips.<br />
                        <br />
                        My hands in my pocket.<br />
                        Her pale chest breathing<br />
                        beneath her pink ski jacket.<br />
                        <br />
                        Her father was dead.<br />
                        Mine was gone.<br />
                        "Don't treat me like some<br />
                        little hoowah," said Jane<br />
                        with a scorn that made<br />
                        her mouth like that of a mouse. <br />
                        <br />
                        Some cold came off the water.<br />
                        The sun was gone. Nothing<br />
                        but a rusty slash growing dark<br />
                        over the airport.<br />
                        <br />
                        It was late.<br />
                        We left through a hole<br />
                        in the shadows.<br />
                        </p>
