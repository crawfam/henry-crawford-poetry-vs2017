            Into the spaces made by <br />
            words I go when famished<br />
            admiring the two tall towers <br />
            that end in 'full' or the way<br />
            the 'y' in 'empty' is like a fork<br />
            of choices or the tectonic way<br />
            that 'ate' slams into 'p' and 'l'<br />
            to make a 'plate' or how<br />
            the stubborn 'n' in 'need'<br />
            can be undone with just a 'd'<br />
            to do the 'deed' as the sum<br />
            of 'something' can overcome<br />
            the no in 'nothing' or how<br />
            it is that just a bit of 'flour'<br />
            can go to work on 'nourish'<br />
            to make it 'flourish' or how<br />
            a single 'u' makes all sound<br />
            in 'you' and a double 'u'<br />
            can take an 'e' from 'feed'<br />
            to make a 'we' to leap across<br />
            an empty space to 'can'<br />
            the way two words together<br />
            can tell us: end hunger.
