<p>    
<i>You ain’t learning nothin’ when you’re talking.</i><br />
A tile’s useless when it lacks good caulking.<br />
Although the craftsman owns the proper tool,<br />
that doesn’t save his art from ridicule:<br />
a telescope don’t make you Stephen Hawking.<br />
<br />
Time doesn’t slow when you neglect your clocking;<br />
Diane von Fürstenberg has finished frocking.<br />
You’re waiting in some slack-jawed vestibule<br />
	and you ain’t learning nothin’.<br />
<br />
A ship is still a vessel in dry-docking.<br />
Velour is valued by its depth of flocking.<br />
When reciprocity’s the golden rule,<br />
as Schopenhauer warns us, “fate is cruel.”<br />
On the Great Blackboard, we are merely chalking,<br />
	and you ain’t learning nothin’.<br />
<br />
