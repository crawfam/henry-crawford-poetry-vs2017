    I.
</p>
<p>
    The breeze blows Tracy's hair and her summer dress, painted with lyrics.<br />She dances with it. Her skin shows no bruises. Her voice thins, thickens.<br />Her partner in all things has been knocked off the earth, and she will go<br />on living. Watching the video, after months away from music, I remem-<br />ber what I loved about performance, from the front row. Every molecule<br /> so visibly troubled, as God's hand troubles the waters. Pain to paint:<br />every drop of blood a shade of red or brown.

    II.

    How I was a tumbleweed with a map. How I landed in Texas for a<br />conference, then played hooky after nightfall, took a drive on the flat<br />cheek of unknown Texas to some other part of the state down roads<br />named for creeks and farm machines. How, after dark, the dry dirt<br />glowed as if waiting for Neil Armstrong to plant his rigid ever-flying flag:<br />lit by headlights, lit by occasional peeks of moon, lit then, at my destina-<br />tion, by trees strung with white Christmas by the yard. How I carried a<br />Colorado beer into a shiny drunk crowd. How my purpose, my favorite<br />trio, appeared and turned the sky around and disappeared as the<br />audience disappeared into the shadows of shacks and kiosks. How I<br />spoke to Simon in the sound booth, in the electric boneyard, only a buzz<br />clinging to cottonwoods. How much a handclasp means in such strange-<br />ness. How I returned to the rent-a-car in the makeshift parking lot, to the<br />car-lit dust, to the sleepers. How I stayed too long at the fair.
