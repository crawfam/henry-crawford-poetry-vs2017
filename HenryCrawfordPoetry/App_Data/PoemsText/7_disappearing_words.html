    First to go were the [vulnerable] with little voice<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no [entitlement] to fairness. Next up<br />
    <br />
    [diversity] was whited out in one clean stroke<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with [evidenced-based] as in "provable",<br />
    <br />
    or "true". Words that made people feel uncomfortable<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like [fetus] or threatened the powerful<br />
    <br />
    like [science-based] had to be deleted. Without words<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can even make a people disappear<br />
    <br />
    so on a plain gray desk, a blunt red pen crossed out<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [transgender] and they were gone.<br />
