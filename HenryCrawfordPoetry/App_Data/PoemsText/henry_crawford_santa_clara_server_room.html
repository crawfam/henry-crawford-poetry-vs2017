                            it's already [tomorrow] in Shanghai [midnight]<br />
                            in [Palo Alto] and I'm working with Kumar [aka]<br />
                            "Leisure Suit Larry" using [SQL commands]<br />
                            on big iron [Oracle] with [SELECT statements]<br />
                            and [WHERE clauses] searching [container] ships<br />
                            for a [box] gone missing in the South China Sea<br />
                            [an odd lot] of Jimmy Buffet [bobble heads]<br />
                            200 cases of Blue Ray [DVDs] and five dozen<br />
                            cartons of Popeye the Sailor [punching bags]<br />
                            turned out by 14-year-old Kim working<br />
                            the long shift in an [orange smog] Guangdong<br />
                            [sweatshop] filling orders for a dollar store<br />
                            In [Des Moines] as our deft fingers scour<br />
                            the [shipping lanes] querying transactions<br />
                            [sorting] [filtering] broadband waves<br />
                            of [structured] [information] in climate<br />
                            controlled [darkness] and I'm thinking<br />
                            about the [punching bag] children<br />
                            winding up their short sleeved arms<br />
                            to bash their plastic foes [and the planet<br />
                            we're burning] to make such happiness<br />
                            [and how that's all we ever wanted]<br />
                            when out of the din of [spinning discs]<br />
                            Larry says he's found the [box] at the bottom<br />
                            of a million record database [grinning]<br />
                            as he explains that it was just a case<br />
                            of a mistaken [space] between the "Pop"<br />
                            and the "eye" in the word "Popeye" and<br />
                            out in the valley the virtual night breathes<br />
                            deep as the world again makes sense<br />
                            <br />
