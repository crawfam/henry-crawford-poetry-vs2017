							Battered around its edges. Dark crevices.<br />
							That was the summer I found the giant conch.<br />
							A sea-scarred surface that held a sound<br />
							<br />
							as present and insistent as the past.<br />
							So, of course, when I saw that photograph,<br />
							I remembered: South Carolina, July.<br />
							<br />
							Hard-edged radiance—<br />
							the two women smiling, kneeling<br />
							in shallow waves unraveling on the shore.<br />
							<br />
							One is white. One is black.<br />
							Both hold my sister and me.<br />
							My mother and Bertha, who helped<br />
							<br />
							take care of us—<br />
							I never knew her other name.<br />
							An exaggerated sheen to the photo,<br />
							<br />
							a Kodachrome romance,<br />
							ocean the same deep green<br />
							as light under trees after rain.<br />
							<br />
							And these two share the same beauty,<br />
							as young, as lovely in their bathing suits<br />
							as movie stars—<br />
							<br />
							and my father, who took the photograph,<br />
							couldn't have been surprised by the phone call<br />
							that came that night. He understood<br />
							<br />
							that world, the way it worked.<br />
							O Bertha, what could he offer you?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
							Some small gesture that dignifies?<br />
							<br />
							Some welcome? It was years later<br />
							I learned my father and my brother 				<br />
							drove her up the coast, to another beach, <br />
							<br />
							one marked Colored—<br />
							A lively pavilion. The Black Pearl.<br />
							Another wind-washed morning.<br />
							<br />
							The same gulls, spots of gray and white				<br />
							against a wall of clouds—<br />
							Now I see us all as we were in that snapshot,<br />
							<br />
							suspended in a complex, imagined <br />
							happiness—<br />
							So much color. The salt-cleansed air.<br />
							<br />
