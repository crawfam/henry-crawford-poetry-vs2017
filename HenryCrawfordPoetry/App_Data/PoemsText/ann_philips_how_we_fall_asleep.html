                        <p>    
                        1. As a door opening in the bed<br />
                        <br />
                        Iron studded, a door thick as peat fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;Escutcheoned latches, hinges flat<br />
                        black in the torchlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Creaking, the light on it shifting: motile darkness in the crack, <br />
                        a hum, smell of peat and metal. Pressed against the chest of the door, you say maybe<br />
                        you won't go in –&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh –&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                        <br />
                        2. As a seed bed of dreams <br />
                        <br />
                        A bed is never smooth but is alive with seeds writhing&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                        lifting, pushing off mother root.<br />
                        Memories elbowing up blind through roughed furrows, uncoiling,<br />
                        swelling into pods of flesh. <br />
                        Scrawny runts cling on, fall away aborted.<br />
                        Then rise the spangled buccaneers.<br />
                        <br />
                        3. As the illusion of rest<br />
                        <br />
                        A tickling, a vibration along the neck, underside of the arm, <br />
                        an inviting refuge floating like a wing feather <br />
                        or a swaddling liquid, the porridge of childhood.<br />
                        Illusion is the always rippled surface – <br />
                        the face of a stranger half-recognized. You follow to wherever it was you met.<br />
                        No tomorrow. Only rest.<br />
                        <br />
                        4. As a door closing<br />
                        <br />
                        Only a rectangle remains: the light outside the fort shrinking back, ebbing<br />
                        from the balcony where old lovers call down their lines. Below now, the<br />
                        doorway narrowing, a triptych-angled slice of bright and the shriek of<br />
                        hinges on the door, fat as a year, warning – get out before it's too late.<br />
                        But it is too late and pawed shadows whirl up and breathe life.<br />
                        <br />
                        5.&nbsp;&nbsp;As death and life on bone <br />
                        <br />
                        In the Book of the Great Liberation, the princess of Kotala was told <br />
                        there were not corpses enough to feed the wild animals. So<br />
                        at dusk she walked companionless to the edge of town <br />
                        amidst the creeping, panting and shrieking.<br />
                        She unwound her garment, lay herself upon the rubble<br />
                        upon the shards of bones half chewed in the cemetery. <br />
                        She called Come.<br />
                        As you lay yourself out, that others might feast.<br />
