[here]<br />
it's [08:45]<br />
let me have a minute<br />
I'm thinking about [Jackie Kennedy]<br />
riding in that Texas car<br />
and [she was trying to scrape a spec of blood off her jacket]<br />
and [she was crawling on the trunk of a bullet riddled limousine]<br />
and [she was sticking her fingers into the holes] feeling the sores<br />
unable to change a single fleck [since she was alive]<br />
and [everything moving around her] was dead<br />
<br />
nowadays<br />
things are [automated]<br />
you can go to a [supermarket] and watch<br />
potatoes tumble in [sudden] [jerks] of rubber belts<br />
pulled  along horizontal cities of [cereal] boxes<br />
of [self-designed wheat from some remote hallucination of farming]<br />
of [soup cans tossed along rivers of code] of [streams of signals]<br />
of [if] [commands] in the relentless flow of  choice and desire<br />
<br />
I was born a town<br />
[now I am a city]<br />
my streets were movies of [singing policemen] and [lonesome cowboys]<br />
and [space girls] and [aliens] and [robots] and [monsters]<br />
and [gangsters] and [men in drag] and [ladies in waiting]<br />
and [cars exploding] and [shooting] and [laughing] and [off-camera loving]<br />
and [I watched it all in temporary forgiveness]<br />
chained as any Platonic cyborg<br />
to [my seat] with you<br />
and [I heard] you asking {"what time is it?"}<br />
and [I could not answer]<br />
even though we keep returning<br />
to [another fleeing minute]<br />
and now it's [08:46] already<br />
