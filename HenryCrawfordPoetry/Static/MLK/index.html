                              Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded  him of his birthright  of freedom, <b>What is the inside color of skin?</b> and something without has reminded him that it can be gained.  Consciously or <b>The color of blood in the vein?</b> unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America <b>How long are the shadows</b> and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense  of great urgency <b>on the other side of the mountain?</b> toward the promised land  of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand  why  public demonstrations <b>How raw the ground</b> are taking place. The Negro has many pent up resentments  and latent frustrations, <b>under the weight of glacial ice?</b> and he must release them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall;   let him go on freedom rides -and try to understand why he must do so. If his repressed  emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression <b>What goes on inside a bullet</b> through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my <b>snapped so sharp?</b> people: "Get rid of your discontent." Rather, I have tried to say that this normal  and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent   direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist. But though I was initially disappointed  <b>How does it know the way across a Tennessee street?</b> at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label.   Was not Jesus an extremist for love: "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,   do good to them  <b>How do we measure the acres of a dream?</b> that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you." <b>Clock the velocity of fear?</b> Was not Amos an extremist for justice: "Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream."     Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian <b>How do we examine the cracks</b> gospel: "I bear in my body  the marks of the Lord Jesus."  Was not Martin Luther an extremist: <b>of a failed foundation?</b> "Here I stand;  I cannot do otherwise, so help me God." And John Bunyan: "I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I  make a butchery  of my  conscience." And <b>Write the future</b> Abraham Lincoln:  "This nation cannot survive half slave  and half free."  And Thomas Jefferson: <b>without a past?</b> "We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men  are created equal . . ." So the question is not whether we   will be extremists,   but what kind of extremists we <b>Speak truth</b> will be. Will we be extremists for hate <b>without trust?</b> or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?  In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men were crucified.    We must never forget  that all three  were crucified for the same  crime--the crime of <b>What do we say to the man on the balcony</b> extremism.  Two were extremists  for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. <b>who never stops waiting for us?</b> The other,  Jesus Christ,  was an extremist for love, truth and goodness,  and thereby rose  above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.
